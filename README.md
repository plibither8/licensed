<hr>

## Setup

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (npm 5.2+) installed on your computer. Then, setup is as simple as:

```sh
$ npx licensed
``` 

If you've got an older version of node (npm version < 5.2) that doesn't yet have [`npx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx), here's a more traditional setup:

```sh
$ npm i -g licensed
```

## Usage

After installation, navigate to your project directory ie. the directory you want your `LICENSE` file to be placed. Then:

```sh
Usage:
    $ licensed                  # Brings up an option to start a questionnaire or choose from a list of available licenses
    $ licensed <license-name>   # Brings prompt to enter your name
    $ licensed <license-name> <your-full-name> [--year | -y] <year>
    $ licensed [--list | -l]

Options:
    --year, -y <year>   Manually enter year the license is in effect
    --list, -l          List all available licenses
    --help              Show this screen
    --version           Show version

Examples:
    $ licensed mit "Mihir Chaturvedi"
    $ licensed apache
    $ licensed --year 2013-2018
```

## Development

Run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/plibither8/licensed.git
$ cd licensed
$ npm link
```

This will setup a symbolic link to the CLI. Any changes in source files will now be reflected when running the `licensed` command.

To lint your code, run

```sh
$ npm run lint
```

...and to build your files to `lib/` directory, run

```sh
$ npm run build
```
